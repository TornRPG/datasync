# datasync
Download Datapacks per Link and copy them directly into the Datapack Directory

Housemade by myself to make the Datapack Development easier for servers!
Also used on the MCTorn Server for easier Datapack Development (@StonkDragon doesnt want always to DM a Admin with FTP Access lmao)


## Commands

/copy - Copies the downloaded Datapack File to the Datapack Folder. (The Filename stays, so if you update, USE THE SAME FILENAME AS PREVIOUSLY)

/sync <Filename> <URL> - Downloads the Datapack to the Filename from the URL.

/update - Checks for Updates of the Plugin,and if there are some, immediately download the Update and replace the old version
