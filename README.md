# datasync
Download Datapacks per Link and copy them directly into the Datapack Directory

Housemade by myself to make the Datapack Development easier for servers!



## Commands

/copy - Copies the downloaded Datapack File to the Datapack Folder. (The Filename stays, so if you update, USE THE SAME FILENAME AS PREVIOUSLY)
/sync <Filename> <URL> - Downloads the Datapack to the Filename from the URL.
